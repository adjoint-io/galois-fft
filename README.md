# galois-fft

The library provides Fast Fourier Transforms over finite fields with
functionality for polynomial evaluation, polynomial interpolation, and
computation of Lagrange polynomials.

In a finite field <img src="/tex/2d4c6ac334688c42fb4089749e372345.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=10.045686749999991pt height=22.648391699999998pt/> with <img src="/tex/f46a5c3deaad97e010fdb1e011e7d93c.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=19.88405924999999pt height=21.839370299999988pt/> elements. We can define a discrete Fourier
transform by selecting <img src="/tex/1683127d6422f667f0fd702f2d9f7d89.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=49.01637509999998pt height=21.839370299999988pt/> roots of unity <img src="/tex/6040a26fde3c8575b728674f140bf80a.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=40.95873044999998pt height=22.648391699999998pt/>.

## Example

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}

module Interpolation where

import Data.Curve.Weierstrass.BN254 (Fr)
import Data.Pairing.BN254 (getRootOfUnity)
import qualified Data.Vector as V
import FFT
import Protolude

k :: Int
k = 5

polySize :: Int
polySize = 2 ^ k

leftCoeffs, rightCoeffs :: V.Vector Fr
leftCoeffs  = V.generate polySize fromIntegral
rightCoeffs = V.generate polySize (fromIntegral . (polySize -))

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print $ interpolate getRootOfUnity leftCoeffs
  print $ fftMult getRootOfUnity leftCoeffs rightCoeffs
  pure ()
```
